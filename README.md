DeltaHacks Hackathon Project:  
This was our first AR project done at Deltahacks! this was a fun interactive way for children (or even adults).
By using the app's camera and selecting the category and language to learn from, the user will then tap anywhere 
and an object from that category will pop up then user will have to select an answer on the side. 
This is a great way to learn and interact with the object as seeing it visually is more easier to learn a language!
